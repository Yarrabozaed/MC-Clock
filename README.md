# Project Goal:
Our system will be marketed for people who are hearing impaired. Our alarm clock will include:

- A display screen so the user can see the time 
- An LED backing that automatically changes color depending on the time of day. 
- Buttons to stop the alarm and buttons to allow the user to adjust the audio output. 
- When the alarm goes off it will trigger preprogrammed audio, flashing lights and a buzzer. 

These features will be useful for all users, both hearing impaired and not. 
The flashing lights and buzzer will allow someone who is hearing impaired to see or feel their alarm
